# commshub-releases

Signed release files for CommsHub. This repository holds release packages only; the source code is private.

Each release has three files:

- `commshub-<version>.zip`, the release package
- `commshub-<version>.zip.sig`, its Ed25519 signature
- `commshub-<version>.zip.manifest.json`, the file list

`commshub update` downloads the newest release from here, checks the signature against the public key built into CommsHub, and refuses anything that does not match. You do not need to download anything by hand.
